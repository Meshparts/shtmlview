# shtmlview

The shtmlview package provides a pure Tcl/Tk widget to display basic HTML and Markdown files. The package requires a installation of the tcllib packages *snit* and optional *Markdown* if Markdown files should be displayed. 

The file `shtmlview.tcl` can be used not only as Tcl package but as well as a standalone application to view Markdown and HTML files directly.

```
tclsh shtmlview.tcl filename.html
```
